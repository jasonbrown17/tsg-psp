## Purpose
Provide password requirements for all users and non-person entities (NPE) who access the Shyft Group's IT resources

## Owner
- Information Security

## Scope
The development of this standard is to promote proper password management and best practices. Proper password management practices protect Shyft's IT resources from potential compromise of user and management level accounts, which could then be used to compromise internal and external systems and data they may contain.

User level accounts are defined as accounts which have no access to add, modify, or delete system level configuration files or software. These accounts are used when logging into a laptop or desktop computer or log into systems from within a trusted network.

Management level accounts, accounts used to add, modify, or delete configurations of resources or software, must use Shyft's multifactor authentication (MFA) when authenticating or elevating to a management level account. In the event that a resource cannot be configured for MFA, the management level password requirements is required in addition to compensating controls.

IT resources have default credentials for use during the initial login to the system. Default credentials are published in the manual from the manufacturer and easily found online. These default credentials must be changed prior to the IT resource being deployed in any environment where the resource will be locally or remotely managed.

NPE authentication is defined as authentication where a system authenticates to another system which requires no user interaction.

#### User Level Password Requirements
| Configuration Item      | Setting       |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| Maximum Password Age    | 180 Days      |
| Password History        | 10 Passwords  |
| Minimum Password Age    | 1 Day         |
| Minimum Password Length | 15 Characters |

#### Management Level Password Requirements
| Configuration Item      | Setting       |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| Maximum Password Age    | 90 Days       |
| Password History        | 10 Passwords  |
| Minimum Password Age    | 1 Day         |
| Minimum Password Length | 24 Characters |

#### Password Complexity
The Identity Provider (IdP) shall be configured to enforce 3 of the 4 following complexity requirements:
- Uppercase
- Lowercase
- Number
- Special Character

#### Account Protections
| Configuration Item       | Setting    |
| ------------------------ | ---------- |
| Account Lockout          | 5 attempts |
| Account Lockout Duration | 30 Minutes |

#### Password Storage
Special care must be taken to ensure that a password, regardless of its classification, must be stored securely to prevent accidental exposure:
- Passwords used in applications or scripts must not be embedded in code
- Passwords stored in a database or directory (such as LDAP) must be stored in a secured, encrypted manner using a one-way hash as defined in 100.03 - Encryption Standard.
- Authentication credentials which are used to access Shyft resources or trusted 3rd parties must be stored in Shyft approved password management applications. Credentials should never be stored in a web browser or file share. Memorized passwords are not required to be placed in a password management system.

#### NPE Authentication
NPE communication must be authenticated prior to sending data and must be encrypted. Authentication mechanisms should be performed through one of the following:
- Mutual SSL/TLS certificate authentication
- API keys
- Public key authentication
